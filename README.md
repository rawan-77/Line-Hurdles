# Line-Hurdles
A program that makes Thymio II robot follow a black winding line while avoiding obstacles placed in its path. I collaborated with 2 teammates during four lab sessions to create this project using ASEBA language. The Thymio robot was able to reach the end of the line hurdles course in under 1 minute and without running into any obstacles.
